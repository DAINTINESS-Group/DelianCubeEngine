/**
 * The abstract class of model components. All instantiations of model components must extend this class.
 * 
 *  The main idea of components is that for each cell of a result, they hold a label. 
 *  Depending on the type of model, this can be a double measurement, a boolean flag, a label, ...
 *  We require that all concrete components export the labels as Strings (so that they can be output to a result file/screen).
 *  This is done via the abstract method  getCellLabelsAsStrings().
 *  It is important that the exported values are a <i>list</i>, so that they are in one-to-one correspondence with the list of cells
 *  that the result of the containing model  has.
 *  Each concrete instantiation of the class can, of course, have more collections and public methods.
